# gpt-narrator
Tabletop RPG content generated by AI

### The idea
Use AI to generate content to be used in RPG sessions and make it public for people to use
 1. Generate some interesting narrative with LLMs starting from a simple idea
 2. Use text-to-speech solutions to generate interesting voiceovers
 3. Generate imagery using AI solutions
 4. Combine all above into video format and post it to social media

### Pixel Art style
I like pixel art and find it easier to engage with AI generated art in this format.
But it might be cool to try other stuff sometime
